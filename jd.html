<p> During my co-op placement at the hospital, I had the opportunity to work in two different departments: physiotherapy and general surgery. In the physiotherapy department, my duties included assisting patients with exercises and stretches, setting up equipment for treatments, and documenting patient progress. The workplace environment was fast-paced and dynamic, with a focus on helping patients recover from injuries or surgeries. In the general surgery unit, I worked as a clerk and was responsible for organizing patient files, scheduling appointments, and answering phone calls.</p>
<p> The physiotherapy department was a more relaxed environment than the surgical unit but still required attention to detail and a strong work ethic. Overall, my co-op placements provided me with invaluable experience in the healthcare field and helped me develop skills that will serve me well in my future career </p>
